        Complete Farmer, a tech-driven agritech company, is on a mission to
        digitize Africa's agricultural value chain. With an ecosystem that
        connects farmers, buyers, and service providers, the company wanted to
        deepen its technological edge by harnessing IoT and cloud capabilities
        to enhance real-time decision-making across farms.

      <ContentSectionfarmer title="The Challenge">
        <>
          Complete Farmer needed to:
          <br />
          <br />• Integrate real-time environmental and soil data from weather
          stations and sensors.
          <br />• Enable remote, continuous monitoring of farm conditions.
          <br />• Create a centralized cloud platform for data processing,
          analytics, and visualization.
          <br />• Ensure secure, scalable infrastructure for managing large
          volumes of time-series data.
          <br />
          <br />
          Their existing infrastructure, while strong in web/mobile platforms
          and API lacked native IoT data handling capabilities and real-time
          analytics at scale.
